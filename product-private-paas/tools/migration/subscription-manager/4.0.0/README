## WSO Private PaaS Migration Tool


This tool will enable users to export tenant subscriptions to a file and import them to another deployment.

# Instructions

1. Build the ppaas-migration tool by running the following command

mvn clean install

2. Deploy the migration.war web archive generated to Stratos Manager in Private PaaS 4.0.0 deployment

3. Update the scripts/export.sh file with details of your old PPaaS deployment and run the script.
   This will create a file named 'subscription-data.json' with all the subscriptions for all tenants.

4. Update the scripts/import.sh file with relevant details of your new PPaaS deployment and run the script.
   This will import all the subscription to the new deployment
